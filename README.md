# casestudy-1
Here is my first kaggle notebook experience with case-study1 from the Google Data Analytics Capstone project. I used the dataset from ../input/cyclistic-bikeshare-analysis-case-study this link which is already uploaded the same dataset what I want to use in my assignment. I applied the R coding of the assignment guides and test run in my kaggle notebook. That is great experience! I enjoyed and happy to work further analysis with my own case study. The notebook is interactive if you are interest, click the link and just hit the run button of rcode chunk. Output data set can found in Github.
